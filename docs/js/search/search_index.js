model.\nI am a fun of Restangular but I've got desapointed with the version of Angular 2+. But since on AngularJs, I wish Restangular could bind them methods on prototype and not inside its body. So I tried to create this lib.\nIt's very experimental and maybe not correctly implemented, but I'm still developing the Idea.\nIf you liked the idea and want to contribute, please send me an e-mail (I need help).\nInstallation\nInstall through npm:\nnpm install --save ngx-restmodelThen create a service that extends RestBase and implement the desireds methods.\nimport { RestBase, Restful } from '../src/index';\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Post } from './models/Post';\n\n@Injectable()\n@Restful({\n  baseUrl: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'\n})\nexport class RestApi extends RestBase {\n  constructor (http: HttpClient) {\n    super(http);\n  }\n\n  // Here you can map the responses direct to your models\n  protected mapModel(route: string, data: any) {\n    if (route === 'posts') {\n      return new Post(data);\n    }\n\n    return data;\n  }\n}Finally use in one of your apps components:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RestApi } from './restApi.service';\nimport { Post } from './models/Post';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'rest-demo-app',\n  template: ``\n})\nexport class DemoComponent {\n  posts: Post[]\n\n  constructor (private restApi: RestApi) {\n  }\n\n  GetPosts() {\n    // Route to the desired path\n    // Get /posts\n    this.restApi.route('posts')\n      .getList()\n      .subscribe(response => {\n        this.posts = response.getPlain();\n\n        // You can route again just like restangular\n        // Get /posts/1/comments\n        response[0].route('comments')\n          .getList()\n          .subscribe(comments => {\n          });\n      });\n  }\n}You may also find it useful to view the demo source. not implemented yet\nDocumentation\nAll documentation is auto-generated from the source via compodoc and can be viewed here:\nhttps://rosostolato.github.io/ngx-restmodel/docs/ not implemented yet\nDevelopment\nPrepare your environment\n\nInstall Node.js and NPM\nInstall local dev dependencies: npm install while current directory is this repo\n\nDevelopment server\nRun npm start to start a development server on port 8000 with auto reload + tests.\nTesting\nRun npm test to run tests once or npm run test:watch to continually run tests.\nRelease\n\nBump the version in package.json (once the module hits 1.0 this will become automatic)npm run release\n\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2018 rosostolato\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

But since on AngularJs, I wish Restangular could bind them methods on prototype and not inside its body. So I tried to create this lib.\nIt's very experimental and maybe not correctly implemented, but I'm still developing the Idea.\nIf you liked the idea and want to contribute, please send me an e-mail (I need help).\nInstallation\nInstall through npm:\nnpm install --save ngx-restmodelThen create a service that extends RestBase and implement the desireds methods.\nimport { RestBase, Restful } from '../src/index';\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Post } from './models/Post';\n\n@Injectable()\n@Restful({\n  baseUrl: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'\n})\nexport class RestApi extends RestBase {\n  constructor (http: HttpClient) {\n    super(http);\n  }\n\n  // Here you can map the responses direct to your models\n  protected mapModel(route: string, data: any) {\n    if (route === 'posts') {\n      return new Post(data);\n    }\n\n    return data;\n  }\n}Finally use in one of your apps components:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RestApi } from './restApi.service';\nimport { Post } from './models/Post';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'rest-demo-app',\n  template: ``\n})\nexport class DemoComponent {\n  posts: Post[]\n\n  constructor (private restApi: RestApi) {\n  }\n\n  GetPosts() {\n    // Route to the desired path\n    // Get /posts\n    this.restApi.route('posts')\n      .getList()\n      .subscribe(response => {\n        this.posts = response.getPlain();\n\n        // You can route again just like restangular\n        // Get /posts/1/comments\n        response[0].route('comments')\n          .getList()\n          .subscribe(comments => {\n          });\n      });\n  }\n}You may also find it useful to view the demo source. not implemented yet\nDocumentation\nAll documentation is auto-generated from the source via compodoc and can be viewed here:\nhttps://rosostolato.github.io/ngx-restmodel/docs/ not implemented yet\nDevelopment\nPrepare your environment\n\nInstall Node.js and NPM\nInstall local dev dependencies: npm install while current directory is this repo\n\nDevelopment server\nRun npm start to start a development server on port 8000 with auto reload + tests.\nTesting\nRun npm test to run tests once or npm run test:watch to continually run tests.\nRelease\n\nBump the version in package.json (once the module hits 1.0 this will become automatic)npm run release\n\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2018 rosostolato\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
